1) Open terminal and check java runtime environment with command "java -version"
If you got output like: "java version "1.8.0_211" you can skip this step, if not -
install jre from:
https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk12-downloads-5295953.html

2) Node.js and npm setup
npm is distributed with Node.js- which means that when you download Node.js, 
you automatically get npm installed on your computer.
Download and install from http://nodejs.org/

3)In terminal(cmd for windows) go to the project folder with:
cd \project_path

4) Run "npm install" command to check and install dependencies
